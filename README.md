Suspent
=======

A hybrid of photography and video, Suspent captures a moment along with 7 seconds of the sounds around it.

This is the Android prototype for an app concept I had which combines the stimulating advantages of video with the meaningfulness of a well-taken photograph.

Suspent is in the same vein as apps like Cinemagram, Manga Camera or Vine. Beyond the novelty of the unique limitations of the capturing experience lies the potential for expression that isn't quite possible with other mediums.

Ideas for expanding on what I've got (aside from a UI/UX overhaul) include:
*  Social Features (Sharing, browsing by region, random)
*  Constantly record audio until the capture button is pressed, at which point the picture is taken, then use the last 5 and next 2 seconds of audio.
